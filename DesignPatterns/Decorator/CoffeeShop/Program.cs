/*
BENEFITS OF DECORATOR PATTERN:
1. SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPLE:
  - Each decorator adds one and only one specific functionality.
  - Base coffee class focus only on core coffee properties.

2. OPEN/CLOSED PRINCIPLE:
  - Open for extension it is easy to add new decorators
  - It is easy to add new component (coffee types)
  - Closed for modification so, existing code doesn't change unless the bussiness rules change.

3. BONUS:
  - We introduce an easy way to enable the creation of an object to be dynamic.

BENEFITS OF FACADE PATTERN:
1. SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPLE:
  - The behavior that might be complex is enclosed in a single class
