# What you need to take into account.

1. Implement design principles not only SOLID
2. The code has some warning fix them as well
3. The code is not well structured take that into account
4. Take into account the primitive obsession principle
5. Take into account the magical number/string anti-pattern you need to fix it

In conclusion, fix all you can
