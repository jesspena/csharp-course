## Design Patterns vs Design Principles vs Architecture Patterns vs Architecture Styles

**Design Patterns** are reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They represent best practices and provide a template for how to solve problems that can be used in many different situations. Design patterns are about organizing classes and objects to solve specific design problems at the code level.

**Design Principles** are fundamental guidelines that inform good software design, such as SOLID principles, DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), or KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid). These are high-level concepts that guide decision-making throughout the development process.

**Architecture Patterns** define the overall structure and organization of software systems at high level. They address how major components interact and are organized at the system level, such as MVC, MVP, or Microservices patterns.

**Architecture Styles** are even broader organizational _paradigms_ that define the fundamental approach to system structure, such as Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), Event-Driven Architecture, or Layered Architecture.

## Classification of Design Patterns

Design patterns are traditionally classified into three main categories:

### 1. Creational Patterns
These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

- **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides global access to it
- **Factory Method**: Creates objects without specifying their exact classes
- **Abstract Factory**: Creates families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes
- **Builder**: Constructs complex objects step by step
- **Prototype**: Creates objects by cloning existing instances

### 2. Structural Patterns
These patterns deal with object composition and relationships between entities.

- **Adapter**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together
- **Bridge**: Separates abstraction from implementation
- **Composite**: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies
- **Decorator**: Adds new functionality to objects dynamically without altering their structure
- **Facade**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem
- **Flyweight**: Reduces memory usage by sharing common parts of state between multiple objects
- **Proxy**: Provides a placeholder or surrogate for another object to control access to it

### 3. Behavioral Patterns
These patterns focus on communication between objects and the assignment of responsibilities.

- **Chain of Responsibility**: Passes requests along a chain of handlers until one handles it
- **Command**: Encapsulates requests as objects, allowing parameterization and queuing
- **Iterator**: Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially
- **Mediator**: Defines how a set of objects interact with each other
- **Memento**: Captures and restores an object's internal state
- **Observer**: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects
- **State**: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes
- **Strategy**: Defines a family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable
- **Template Method**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm, letting subclasses override specific steps
- **Visitor**: Separates algorithms from the objects on which they operate

In .NET 8, many of these patterns are implemented using modern C# features like generics, delegates, LINQ, and dependency injection, making them more elegant and type-safe than in traditional implementations.

## What is an Anti-Pattern?

An **anti-pattern** is a common response to a recurring problem that is usually ineffective and risks being highly counterproductive. It's essentially a "bad solution" to a design problem that initially appears to be beneficial but ultimately creates more problems than it solves. Anti-patterns are the opposite of design patterns - they represent what NOT to do.

## Why Singleton Can Be an Anti-Pattern

The Singleton pattern, while useful in certain scenarios, is often considered an anti-pattern for several reasons:

### 1. **Hidden Dependencies**
Singletons create implicit dependencies that aren't visible in class constructors or method signatures, making code harder to understand and test.

### 2. **Global State**
Singletons introduce global state into applications, which can lead to unpredictable behavior, especially in multi-threaded environments.

### 3. **Testing Difficulties**
- Hard to mock or stub for unit testing
- Tests can become interdependent because they share the same singleton instance
- Difficult to reset state between tests

### 4. **Tight Coupling**
Classes that use singletons become tightly coupled to the singleton implementation, violating the Dependency Inversion Principle.

### 5. **Thread Safety Issues**
Implementing thread-safe singletons is complex and error-prone, especially in multi-threaded applications.

### 6. **Violates Single Responsibility Principle**
Singletons manage both their own lifecycle AND their intended functionality.

In .NET, dependency injection containers often provide better alternatives to singletons by managing object lifetimes without the drawbacks.

## Common Anti-Patterns

### **Creational Anti-Patterns**
- **Object Orgy**: Creating too many small objects that don't encapsulate meaningful behavior
- **Poltergeists**: Classes that have limited responsibilities and short lifecycles

### **Structural Anti-Patterns**
- **God Object/God Class**: A class that knows too much or does too much
- **Blob**: Similar to God Object - one class doing everything
- **Lava Flow**: Dead code that remains in the system because nobody dares to remove it
- **Spaghetti Code**: Code with complex and tangled control structures

### **Behavioral Anti-Patterns**
- **Golden Hammer**: Using a familiar technology/pattern for every problem ("When you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail")
- **Cargo Cult Programming**: Including code without understanding why it's needed
- **Copy-Paste Programming**: Duplicating code instead of creating reusable abstractions
- **Magic Numbers/Strings**: Using unexplained numeric or string literals throughout code

### **Architectural Anti-Patterns**
- **Big Ball of Mud**: A system lacking perceivable architecture
- **Stovepipe System**: Subsystems that don't integrate well with each other
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Architecture that makes it difficult to switch vendors or technologies

### **Management/Process Anti-Patterns**
- **Analysis Paralysis**: Over-analyzing problems without taking action
- **Design by Committee**: Having too many people involved in design decisions
- **Feature Creep**: Continuously adding features without considering the overall design
- **Silver Bullet**: Believing that a single technology or methodology will solve all problems

### **.NET Specific Anti-Patterns**
- **Improper Exception Handling**: Catching and swallowing exceptions without proper handling
- **Synchronous over Asynchronous**: Not using async/await properly in I/O operations
- **Memory Leaks**: Not properly disposing of resources or managing event subscriptions
- **N+1 Query Problem**: Making multiple database queries in loops instead of using joins or bulk operations

The key to avoiding anti-patterns is understanding why they're problematic and learning to recognize them early in the design process. Code reviews, automated analysis tools, and following established principles like SOLID can help prevent many anti-patterns from creeping into your codebase.
